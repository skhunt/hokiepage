<h2>The last time I took classes at VT was the fall semester of 2014 when I graduated with my Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology. Here's what my final classes were!</h2>
        
<h3>Renaissance Literature</h3>

	<p>This course presented Renaissance British literature from 1500-1660 in its representative models and defining contexts, including the discovery of the Copernican universe and the new world, the rise of Protestantism, the resultant Counter-reformation, the movement from humanism to empiricism, and the institution of Parliamentary democracy. Texts included poetry, prose, and drama. </p>

<h3>Industrial/Organizational Psychology</h3>
    <p>This course was designed to teach a basic understanding of research and practice of behavioral science as related to organizations. I/O psychologists advance science by creating knowledge relevant to organizational functioning. As practicing psychologists, I/O psychologists serve organizations as both internal and external consultants, solving problems in order to improve organizational efficiency and effectiveness. We engaged in a semester-long team problem-solving exercise designed to simulate how managers solve problems in an organization. </p>

<h3>Criminology</h3>
    <p>The goal of this course was to enable the student to use sociological perspectives when thinking about the dynamics of crime, criminal behavior, constitutional/criminal law, life, and the impact of globalization has on our constructed reality.   </p>

<h3>Juvenile Delinquency</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the course was to provide the student with a survey of the history and measurement of delinquency, casual explanations of delinquency, and societal responses to delinquent behavior. The content included numerous references to sociological terms and concepts, with information drawn from domestic and international studies.</p>
